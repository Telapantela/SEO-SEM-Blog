| **Aspect**          | **Visual Search 🔍**                  | **Image Search 🚨**           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Input Method**    | Images (photos, screenshots)          | Keywords, text descriptions   |
| **Technology**      | AI, machine learning, computer vision | Metadata, alt-text analysis   |
| **Accuracy**        | High (context-based recognition)      | Moderate (keyword-reliant)    |
