## 🔍 What is AI-Powered Search?

**AI-powered search** leverages artificial intelligence to deliver more accurate, personalized, and context-aware search results. Unlike traditional search engines, which rely heavily on keyword matching, AI-powered search focuses on understanding the **intent** and **context** behind user queries. Here’s how it works:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Understands conversational queries (e.g., "What’s the best Italian restaurant near me?").
- **Intent Recognition:** Identifies whether the user is looking for information, products, or local services.
- **Contextual Understanding:** Considers user behavior, location, and search history to deliver personalized results.
- **Machine Learning:** Continuously improves algorithms based on user interactions.

### 📌 Traditional vs. AI-Powered Search

| **Aspect**        | **Traditional Search** | **AI-Powered Search** |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Keyword Focus     | High                   | Low                   |
| Personalization   | Limited                | Dynamic               |
| Context Awareness | Basic                  | Advanced              |
| Algorithm Updates | Periodic               | Continuous            |
