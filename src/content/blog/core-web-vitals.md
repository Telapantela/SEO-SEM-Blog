## 🔍 What Are Core Web Vitals?

Core Web Vitals consist of **three primary metrics** that measure a website’s performance:

### 1️⃣ **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): Loading Performance**

📌 **Definition:** Measures the time it takes for the largest visible content (image, text, or video) to load on the screen.  
📏 **Google’s Benchmark:** **LCP < 2.5 seconds**  
📈 **Why It Matters:** Faster loading times reduce bounce rates and improve engagement.  
⚡ **Optimization Tips:**

- ✅ Use a high-speed **hosting provider** and **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**.
- ✅ **Optimize and compress images** (WebP, AVIF).
- ✅ **Implement lazy loading** for offscreen elements.

### 2️⃣ **First Input Delay (FID): Interactivity**

📌 **Definition:** Measures the delay between user interaction (clicks, taps) and the browser’s response.  
📏 **Google’s Benchmark:** **FID < 100 milliseconds**  
📈 **Why It Matters:** Faster interactivity leads to better user satisfaction.  
⚡ **Optimization Tips:**

- ✅ Minimize **JavaScript execution** and defer non-essential scripts.
- ✅ Optimize **browser caching** and reduce server response time.
- ✅ Reduce the impact of **third-party scripts** (ads, widgets).

### 3️⃣ **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): Visual Stability**

📌 **Definition:** Measures unexpected layout shifts that disrupt the user experience.  
📏 **Google’s Benchmark:** **CLS < 0.1**  
📈 **Why It Matters:** Prevents elements from moving unexpectedly, reducing frustration.  
⚡ **Optimization Tips:**

- ✅ Set explicit **size attributes** for images, videos, and iframes.
- ✅ Avoid inserting **dynamic content** above existing elements.
- ✅ Use **fonts that load asynchronously**.

## 🔥 What’s New for Core Web Vitals in 2025? (INP Replacing FID)

🔹 **Google is replacing First Input Delay (FID) with Interaction to Next Paint (INP)** for better measurement of user experience.

📏 **INP Benchmark:** **< 200 milliseconds**  
📈 **Why It Matters:** INP provides a more **accurate measure of real-world interactivity and user frustration**.
