## 🚀 What Are Core Web Vitals? (Quick Answer)

> Core Web Vitals are a set of performance metrics defined by Google to measure user experience on websites. They focus on loading speed (LCP), interactivity (INP), and visual stability (CLS)—directly impacting SEO rankings in 2025.

### ⚡ **Key Metrics at a Glance:**

| **Metric**                      | **Good Score**         | **Impact on SEO** |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)  | Less than 2.5 seconds  | 35% ranking boost |
| Interaction to Next Paint (INP) | Under 200 milliseconds | 25% ranking boost |
| Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)   | Below 0.1              | 20% ranking boost |

## 🔍 The 3 Core Web Vitals Explained

### 1️⃣ **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) – Speed Matters**

- **What is it?** Measures loading performance (images, videos, text).
- **Good Score:** < 2.5 seconds
- **Impact:** Faster load = higher rankings + lower bounce rates

**🚀 Quick Wins for LCP:**

- Compress images using modern formats like WebP or AVIF.
- Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for faster global load times.
- Optimize server response by reducing Time to First Byte (TTFB).

**Pro Tip:** Use tools like [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app) for image compression and [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) for CDN services.

---

### 2️⃣ **Interaction to Next Paint (INP) – Make It Snappy**

- **What is it?** Measures responsiveness during user interactions (clicks, taps).
- **Good Score:** < 200 ms
- **Impact:** Fast interactivity = better UX + more conversions

**⚡ How to Improve INP:**

- Minimize JavaScript execution time using code splitting and tree shaking.
- Optimize event handlers with debouncing and throttling.
- Reduce main thread blocking by offloading tasks to Web Workers.

**Pro Tip:** Use [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) to identify JavaScript bottlenecks.

---

### 3️⃣ **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) – Keep It Stable**

- **What is it?** Measures unexpected layout shifts.
- **Good Score:** < 0.1
- **Impact:** Stable layouts = improved user satisfaction + reduced frustration

**✅ CLS Optimization Tips:**

- Always set width and height attributes for images and videos.
- Reserve space for dynamic content like ads or pop-ups.
- Preload fonts using `<link rel="preload">` to prevent late shifts.

**Pro Tip:** Use [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) to detect and debug layout shifts.
